# Notes

You can always try and find people on Quora (follow them, it's a great source of content). Then you also have Twitter of course where you can follow and form a related network; engage with them, follow and join/start a discussion.
Furthermore you should join related channels on #Slack. #CreativeTribes is a great community, it's a fee (donation) to join but it's the best place to build up and join a like-minded community/network. You can also join channels like #startup and #FEDs. For a more comprehensive list of #Slack channels take a look here:

Other things you can take a look at, I'm sure you'll like them:
Product Hunt: http://www.producthunt.com
Growth Hackers: https://growthhackers.com/
Just "hunt" down people from these networks, connect with them on Twitter and expand you network. You should be connected with people with similar interest in no time.
Feel free to add me to your network as well. You can find me pretty much everywhere but here is my Twitter.
